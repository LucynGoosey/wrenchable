# wrenchable

Spigot plugin intended as a replacement for VanillaTweak's Redstone Wrench and Terracotta Wrench datapacks with extra features and less lag.

* More stuff to spin - including logs, shulkerboxs, stairs, skulls and banners. See [config.yml](src/main/resources/config.yml) for the full list
* Compatible with the VanillaTweak's wrench companion resourcepack
* Old wrenches made with the datapack *should* be recognized by the plugin (untested)
* Same crafting recipe
* Doesn't delete items in containers like the datapack did
